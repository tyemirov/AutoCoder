# ISSUES
**Append-only section-based log**

Entries record newly discovered requests or changes, with their outcomes. No instructive content lives here. Read @NOTES.md for the process to follow when fixing issues.

Each issue is formatted as `- [ ] [<ID>-<number>]`. When resolved it becomes -` [x] [<ID>-<number>]`

Read @AGENTS.md, @ARCHITECTURE.md, @POLICY.md, PLANNING.md, @NOTES.md, @README.md and @ISSUES.md. Start working on open issues, prioritizing bug fixes. Work autonomously and stack up PRs.
