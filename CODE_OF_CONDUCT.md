# Code of Conduct

This project aims to be a welcoming, inclusive place where people from every ecosystem can collaborate on smarter autonomous coding workflows. Whether you write Hack, PHP, Go, Python, or anything else, your ideas and pull requests are valued.

## Our commitment

We pledge to treat everyone with respect and empathy, to listen before reacting, and to act in ways that keep this community productive, curious, and friendly. Harassment, bullying, or exclusionary behavior of any kind are not acceptable here.

## What we expect from you

- Speak up when you see problems and help fix them constructively.
- Respect differences in background, experience, toolchains, and preferred workflows.
- Keep feedback focused on the work; critique solutions, not people.
- Accept that mistakes happen and be ready to learn from them.

## How to contribute

1. Read through the repository’s guiding docs (`AGENTS.md`, `NOTES.md`, etc.) so your contributions align with the existing guardrails.
2. Open an issue in `ISSUES.md` or a pull request describing what you want to change, and mention your preferred stack (Hack, PHP, etc.), so we can coordinate the right reviewers.
3. Drop a link to your draft PR in the issue thread if you’d like early feedback before merging.

Encourage other ecosystems by linking to their tooling, providing stack-specific notes when relevant, and inviting collaborators to jump in.

## Reporting issues

If you encounter behavior that violates this code of conduct, please open an issue titled `Code of Conduct: [short summary]` so the maintainers can respond privately and resolve the situation quickly.
